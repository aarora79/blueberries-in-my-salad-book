<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Preface</h1>
<p>This is neither a book on salads, nor a commentary on life. What it is, is a journal of experiences that my wife and me had in our journey towards being fit and strong. Like a salad, day to day life may not be the most appealing lunch option, but just like a good salad if you can keep finding the blueberries every now and again, it is both rewarding and fullfilling. The small and big milestones we achieved during our journey kept us going, just like the blueberries in our salad.</p>
<p>I wanted to write a book documenting our (would be more appropriate to say my) fat to fit journey on a day to day or at least a week by week basis. As things progressed, and I looked around, I realized that we were probably the million’th couple in the world doing this and the Internet was filled with blogs and youtube videos that document in great detail very successful and inspiring transformational stories. Why was I wanting to reinvent the wheel by writing our story on the same lines? I realized that while a daily or weekly journal was not something i could do but definitely there were “topics” on which i would like to pen down my thoughts. For example, the most often asked question, “what diet are we following?”, “do i really need a trainer?”, “just tell me how long would it take to lose 10 pounds” and so on. Therefore i decided to write this book as a collection of essays on these and other related topics.</p>
<p>It has been more than 6 months since we started this journey and I feel that we have learnt so much that it is important to document this first and foremost for our own selves and then also for anyone who might be interested (i hope someone is). After all, it is one thing to see someone famous transform and another thing to see someone you know or could relate to (middle aged Punjabi NRI couple anyone?) do the same and then realize “if they could do it, so can i”.</p>
<p>We took daily measurements for our weight and other biometrics and they were automatically synced via an app on our phone. This is huge, daily tracking enables, even forces, conversations around progress (or lack thereof) towards your targets. It keeps you honest and on track. What it also enables is to see the big picture over time, such as are you slowing down, do you need to make adjustments to your routine, how much that elaborate weekend dinner set you back? For me personally, as a data scientist it was fascinating to collect the raw data, find patterns, gain insights and also get some forecasts done (when would we reach our target weight?).</p>
<p>Over time i understood that while the desire for weight loss was what got me here, but what i was really gaining was good health and strength. To reduce the benefits of what we were doing to just burning calories and losing tens of pounds now seems like a terrible underselling of the idea of fitness. The human body is a fascinating machine capable of wonderful things, good health is a state of both mind and body. Excercise and healthy eating habits help both mind and body. If you do not have any serious health issues there isn’t really any excuse for not excercising regularly and eating healthy. As it is said “शरीरमाद्यं खलु धर्मसाधनम्” i.e. the body is the instrument of all good deeds.</p>
