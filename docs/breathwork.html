<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 9</span> Breathwork</h1>
<p>I am a software developer by training. One of the things that I learnt early on was that if you wanted to optimize a computer program so that it ran faster then you wanted to optimize the one module that in itself might appear trivial and hidden from the user visible functionality but was performed repeatedly and therefore any improvement in it had a multiplicative effect on the performance of the overall program. Breathing is that hidden module in the human system. We breath about 20,000 times a day on an average, it is an involuntary action for the most part and even a small improvement in breathing can have a huge impact on our health, both mental and physical.</p>
<p>When I started training, our trainer told us about breathing patterns appropriate for a particular exercise but I did not focus on that too much because I was so new to workout and exercise and my forms were so clumsy that adding a breathing pattern to an exercise was just one thing too many. As my forms improved, some basic movements and bracing became a part of habit and I did not actively need to be aware of them, they just happened, maybe that freed up some of my brain to focus on the missing link i.e. breathing. In any case, that is hindsight. It all started with me reading James Nestor’s wonderful book called “Breath: the new science of a lost art”. I think I stumbled upon some YouTube video about it, I don’t remember for sure but as I read a little bit about the book I was convinced I need to read it. I am so happy that I did. The book has many references to ancient Indian breathing practices and I asked myself “why am I not trying some if not all of this?”. After finishing that book, I read Dr Belisa Vranich’s book “Breathing for warriors” and devoured every YouTube video and podcast I could find about breathwork.</p>
<div id="two-fundamentals" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Two fundamentals</h2>
<p>The two most fundamental things that you can (and should) so are nasal breathing and horizontal breath or belly breathing. First up, the mouth is not meant for breathing the nose is, unless you are completely out of breath say while doing a hard exercise routine, you should not normally need to breath through your mouth. Breathing through the nose offers a natural filtering mechanism to keep the harmful things out of your body, prevents dental problems and in general helps keep you calm and relaxed. I remember growing up, I used to have frequent colds and used to breath through my mouth a lot and my mother had a very tough time constantly reminding me (often in public) to keep my mouth closed. As I grew up and my immunity got better, the frequent colds went away and while I did not breath through my mouth as much but it was not something that I paid attention to, not sure most people do.</p>
<p>After reading James Nestor’s book I started being conscious about nose breathing and any time I found myself breathing through the mouth I immediately switched to nose breathing. Then one day I decided to see if I could train with my mouth closed and only breathing through the nose. I barely made it past the 5 minute warmup before I had to open my mouth for breathing. I persisted, and it got better, in a couple of weeks I could finish a 10-15 minute strength training portion of the portion of the workout which usually involved heavy deadlifts, back squats or other compound exercises. Whenever I did heavy cardio, such as sprints, a few calories on the assault bike, burpees and such I had to open my mouth. I knew I was getting better though. A couple of months into the nose breathing and I could finish the cardio portion as well. Today (about 6 months in), I am able to complete the entire 50-60 minute workout without having to breath through my mouth, and more importantly, I do not even feel the need to (of course talking to the trainer or having a sip of water means I do breath through my mouth in between sets). I no longer feel out of breath while working out, my heart rate remains under 140 even during intense cardio and my endurance levels improved tremendously.</p>
<p>The other fundamental is horizontal breathing or belly breath or diaphragmatic breathing. Put simply, a belly breath means expanding your belly as you inhale so that your lungs push your diaphragm down and contracting your belly while exhaling so that your diaphragm expands and moves upwards. This is best understood by seeing some visualizations and videos, there are many, but I would recommend Dr Belisa Vranich. It takes some practice to unlearn how we have been breathing all this while and how we used to breath in early childhood.</p>

<div id="our-breathwork-routine" class="section level2" number="9.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Our breathwork routine</h2>
<p>It all starts the night before. To improve sleep we use the 4-7-8 breathing technique just before sleeping. It is extremely relaxing and helps to fall asleep so much faster. I learnt it from watching Dr Andrew Weil’s video recommended from James Nestor’s book. We do it once a day right before sleeping, or any time during the day if the stress level gets really high. The technique is really simple, touch the rough of your mouth with your tongue, inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds and then exhale for 8 seconds, repeat this 4-7-8 cycle 4 times. Takes less than 90 seconds total. As with everything else, takes several weeks of consistent practice to see the benefits. There is an app for the 4-7-8 breath, it does the time tracking for you, making the whole proces very easy.</p>
<p>We tape our mouth while sleeping. It is just a small tape put vertically over the center of the lips. It is to ensure that we do not breath through our nose even while sleeping. I know it sounds at least a little bit weird that we tape our mouth but it has definitely improved the quality of our sleep. Even with fewer hours of sleep I feel refreshed when I wake up (I am not suggesting this as a way of getting by with less sleep, certainly not, I wish everyone is able to get a good 8-hour sleep). The first time I tried it, I had to take it off after a couple of hours, but then the next day it was fine and then after that, this is just how we sleep now.</p>
