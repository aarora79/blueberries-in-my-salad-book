# For cultural enrichment

As one of my professors in graduate school used to say, read this for cultural enrichment, I am providing here a list of links from the Internet that I stumbled upon and found useful. Make what you will of it.


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  gt(df_references) %>%
    tab_header(
      title = md("**References**"),
      subtitle = md("Videos & Blogs I Liked")
    )
```
