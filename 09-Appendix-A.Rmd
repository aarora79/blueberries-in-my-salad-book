## Food checklist for clean eating challenge

This table lists the food items we could think of (from what we generally eat) in each of the categories listed for the 30-day clean eating challenge. It also contains certain other categories that we added based on the food items in our pantry. The purpose here was to get a clear Yay or Nay listed alongside each food item so that we knew exactly what is allowed and did not end up with a day 0 crisis at our hands.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df_clean_eating_list %>%
    gt::gt(groupname_col = 'Food Category') %>%
    tab_header(
      title = md("**Food items we got reviewed for the clean eating challenge**"),
      subtitle = md("Tried to cover everything we could think of...")
    ) 

#  gt( %>% dplyr::group_by(``)) %>%
#    tab_header(
#      title = md("**Food items we got reviewed for the clean eating challenge**"),
#      subtitle = md("Tried to cover everything we could think of...")
#    )  %>%
#    tab_source_note(
#      source_note = md("This list held us in good stead over the two rounds of clean eating that we #did.")
#    )
