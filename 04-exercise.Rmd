# Exercise: Putting in the hard yards

You would have probably heard that managing weight is 70% about nutrition and 30% about exercise. I think this correct. Having said that, we should not downplay the 30% i.e the exercise. As I have mentioned earlier in the book, a few years back I tried a purely diet based plan and achieved good results. The problem with it, like with all diet based plans, was that it was not sustainable. There is another aspect to this as well, when I tried losing weight purely via the diet route (could also call it calorie counting) my overall appearance became thinner or I would even say weaker. While I do not recall feeling lack of energy but the appearance was as if I had just lost a lot of weight and it did not look healthy. Several people asked me out of genuine concern if I was sick and when I told them that I was doing this diet their reactions were on the lines of "ok, but don't do more of it". This time however, things are different, both me and my wife look leaner and fitter. Our body structure has become "denser" if that is the right word to use here and it is because of that we look thinner, fit into much smaller clothes. Appearance wise we do not have the starved look that I suppose comes from severe calorie restricted diets. Without a doubt, this is the result of the rather intensive exercise routine that we now have.

## There is always a 1st time

When I went to the gym for the first time this year, it was not just the first time for me in the year 2020 but it was for the first time in my entire 41 years. I had no illusions of how supremely unfit I was and how difficult this was going to be. Sometimes, I used to see people exiting after their class and I used to tell myself "OK, that person looked great, but that is probably because he has been working out since forever". Ofcourse, this may or may not have been true, but my goal was to keep telling myself that if I was disciplined enough to show up rain or shine and do the exercises as told then I would get better, that is just how it works (at least that is what I told myself anyway). 

I look at some old videos now of me doing exercises like planks or air-squats when I started and I compare them with the more recent ones of me doing the same exercise. My movements used to be very clumsy, almost hilarious, and it is to the credit of the trainer that she did not give up on me. Nidhi on the other hand, being a dancer, her movements had a natural rhythm, she had flexibility, speed and having done some exercises while growing up, she was much more comfortable with the whole setup. My objective was not to be as good as her but to simply by better than me from four weeks ago.

We started with working out twice a week, and then went to thrice, and then four times and now I work out five times a week. Nidhi tried the four times a week routine but is now nicely settled into three times a week. In 8 months I have come from having to push myself to workout twice a week to now seems like my body cannot have enough of it. Of course, it helps that because of Corona, we are all working from home so we have a little more flexibility with time. If there is one silver lining that I can see this otherwise disaster of an year, it is this.

One day a couple of months into training, I stumbled upon a YouTube video of the training routine of an actress who played the role of a superhero in one of her movies. Her trainer said when she came to the gym and looked at people doing pullups and deadlifts, her reaction was that oh yeah this is cool and all but I can't do that, and a few months later she was deadlifting 235 pounds. When I saw the video, I had a similar reaction. I thought sure, a Hollywood actress with a celebrity trainer can ofcourse do this, I can't. I WAS WRONG. I recently deadlifted 255 pounds, and while I haven't done pullups yet, I can at least visualize myself doing them, not easy, but definitely possible.

## Our workout routine

I am clearly not qualified to talk about the technical details about what makes a good workout but I can certainly state what we did and loved. 

Our workout sessions were an hour long and were mostly divided into four parts:

- Warm up (about 5 minutes)
- Strength (about 10 to 15 minutes)
- Strength & Conditioning (15 to 20 minutes)
- Core (5 minutes)

With some rest time and setting up equipment for different exercises the above routines added upto an hour (give or take 5 minutes). From mid January when we started to about the end of March we were working out twice of week in our trainer's gym and since then we have been working out at home and our home gym has slowly metamorphosed from being your amateur home gym to a souped up version with lots of weights, barbell, deadlift equipment, resistance bands, boxes, pull up bars, rowing machine etc. Some of the stuff we bought, some our trainer was kind enough to lend us for a while (because Corona). Here are a couple of pictures.

![Rowing machine and cycle](pictures/gym1.jpg)

For a long time, and even today, I tell myself before the workout, that warmups are easy, the strength portion is just 10 minutes so it will be over quickly before I realize and then the conditioning is the only part that I have to push through and then by the time I am half way through the conditioning it would be almost over and then core is super easy (it is not). This kind of mental setup helps me get through the hour. Ofcourse once I am in the middle of it, unless the workout on the day absolutely pulverizes me, my mind goes almost totally blank, no thoughts at all. I have experienced this many times, going into the workout from a crisis at work is a huge mental shift. Once the workout is over, I realize that maybe the work problems are not that insurmountable as they appeared an hour back. It could be the endorphins kicking in, or just the fact that I have had the oppurtunity to (forcibly) extricate myself from the crisis situation and now after an hour I am able to think more clearly. I do not know what is the reason, but I do know that I experience mental clarity after the workout.

The following tables show the different exercises we did, over time, as part of the warmups, strength, conditioning and core. These are over a period of time, with the more difficult ones such as the Turkish getup added much later and for the ones which we did from the start we kept on increasing the weights or the numbers of sets and reps over time.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  gt(df_exercises) %>%
    tab_header(
      title = md("**Exercise Routine**"),
      subtitle = md("So many different exercises for different muscles")
    )  %>%
    tab_source_note(
      source_note = md("Not a complete list, just the ones I randomly remembered.")
    )
```

The conditioning part of the routine usually consisted of either a 12 minute AMRAP (as many rounds as possible) or a 12 minute EMOM (every minute on the minute) or sometimes a HIIT (high intensity interval training) such as Tabata or on some days just a combination of exercises.

## Our calendar so far

The following chart shows the calendar for the year 2020 with the days we exercised marked with an [E] and the amount of weight lost/gained reflected by the color. Red indicates weight loss and green indicates weight gain. More "red" than "green" in a month means overall we lost weight in that month. I like this chart a lot because it brings out very clearly that weight loss is never a straight line, you gain some (days) and you lose some (days), except in this case, losing is better.

         week = epiweek(DateCol))

# isoweek makes the last week of the year as week 1, so need to change that to week 53 for the plot
dfPlot$week[dfPlot$month=="Dec" & dfPlot$week ==1] = 53

  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size=15, face = "bold"))

```

You can notice in the charts the number of days marked as [E] (for exercise) has increased over the months. This is something that happened organically. As we exercised more and ate right, the body became stronger and it could take on more work and so we exercised even more, it became a self driving cycle. Exercise also gives you a "high", a feeling of euphoria, you cannot miss it. In other words, this increased number of workouts, doing more sets and reps, this was only partially driven by just the motivation to lose weight, the rest of it was because a) the body became strong enough that the current load became easier and so a step up was needed and b) the desire for that "high", it makes you want to get more of the stuff that got you here in the first place. If this book ever gets into the hands of someone who has exercised for any length of time, I would like to add that what I have written here may seem routine and totally on expected lines to you but to me this was unlike anything I had experienced before, it was a joyous discovery.

## What does'nt kill you makes stronger

Deadlifts are my favorite. They are a full body exercise, our trainer says deadlifts are a game changer. I have watched a lot of celebrity trainers on YouTube and heard them echo the same sentiments. While we did several different variants of the deadlift such as the single leg stiff leg deadlift, the sumo stance deadlift etc. but my personal favorite and something that i religiously tracked was the deadlift with a hexbar. Maybe it had to do something with the visual imagery I had in my head of this being a strong man's exercise. I remember that when I first saw the hexbar in the gym I asked our trainer when are we doing that and she said, you will get there in a couple of weeks (this was sometime in mid to late February). The hexbar weighed 55 pounds, it was the heaviest they had.

The first day I tried it, I recall that the trainer was very cautious, I don't know if she thought I could even do it (I was fat and never been to the gym until last 2 months remember, this was February) or not. To this day, when I have graduated from lifting the hexbar with no weights to lifting the same hexbar with 100 pound weights on either side, she is still extremely cautious and correctly so. I have heard from her that it is possible to deadlift 3 times your body weight, while that is not my target, I do want to get to deadlifting 400 pounds eventually, maybe sometime in 2021.

Here is a chart that puts this all in perspective. You can see a boxplot of the deadlifts I did over time alongwith a line chart showing my weight. As my body weight is going down, I am lifting more and more. In late August, I reached a point where I was deadlifting more than my body weight. The target for 2020 is to be able to deadlift 300 pounds.
