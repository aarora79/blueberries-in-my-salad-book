# Podcasts, Videos and References

As one of my professors in graduate school used to say, read this for cultural enrichment, I am providing here a list of links from the Internet that I stumbled upon and found useful. Make what you will of it.

## General

**The Huberman Lab Podcast**

[https://hubermanlab.com/](https://hubermanlab.com/)

This podcast is at the top of my list and for good reason. Imagine being able to sit in a class with a professor patiently delving into the depths of latest research but still keeping the material at a level consumable by informed and interested individuals. This is that podcast. Dr Huberman talks about all things health, whether it is sleep, hormones, circadian rhythms, muscle building and so much more. The best part is that he explains the mechanics of why things work the way they work and then provides protocols that can be (relatively) easily incorporated into daily life. I have benefited immensely from this podcast.
