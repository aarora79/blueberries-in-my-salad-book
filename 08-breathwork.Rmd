# Breathwork

I am a software developer by training. One of the things that I learnt early on was that if you wanted to optimize a computer program so that it ran faster then you wanted to optimize the one module that in itself might appear trivial and hidden from the user visible functionality but was performed repeatedly and therefore any improvement in it had a multiplicative effect on the performance of the overall program. Breathing is that hidden module in the human system. We breath about 20,000 times a day on an average, it is an involuntary action for the most part and even a small improvement in breathing can have a huge impact on our health, both mental and physical.

When I started training, our trainer told us about breathing patterns appropriate for a particular exercise but I did not focus on that too much because I was so new to workout and exercise and my forms were so clumsy that adding a breathing pattern to an exercise was just one thing too many. As my forms improved, some basic movements and bracing became a part of habit and I did not actively need to be aware of them, they just happened, maybe that freed up some of my brain to focus on the missing link i.e. breathing. In any case, that is hindsight. It all started with me reading James Nestor's wonderful book called "Breath: the new science of a lost art". I think I stumbled upon some YouTube video about it, I don't remember for sure but as I read a little bit about the book I was convinced I need to read it. I am so happy that I did. The book has many references to ancient Indian breathing practices and I thought why am I not trying some if not all of this. After finishing that book, I read Dr Belisa Vranich's book "Breathing for warriors" and devoured every YouTube video and podcast I could find about breathwork.
