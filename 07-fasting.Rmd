# Fasting: not for weight loss but for aoveral health and longevity

Growing up fasting for religious reasons on special days was very normal. We did it several times a year as a family. The focus was not so much on the health benefits but more on the spiritual side of it (abstinence from food helps brings the focus inwards, maybe). As I grew older, I started looking at these fasts more and more as an opportunity to test self-control, with work, travel and other day to day life situations it was always some what of a challenge. Even though the fasts themselves did not involve going without food for long hours (certainly not days), you could always eat something from the allowed set of food items. It was still a challenge though.

One thing that my fasting experience growing up taught me that "hunger comes and goes, and it always gets better" especially with the multi-day fasts (again, there were always some allowed food items such as fruits, nuts, certain vegetables), I knew the first day was the most difficult and by the 3rd day while the mind certainly wanted certain food, the body was not missing anything and in fact felt better than it did before fasting.
