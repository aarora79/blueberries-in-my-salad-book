# Fasting: not for weight loss but for aoveral health and longevity

Growing up, fasting for religious reasons on special days was very normal. We did it several times a year as a family. The focus was not so much on the health benefits but more on the spiritual side of it (abstinence from food helps brings the focus inwards, maybe). As I grew older, I started looking at these fasts more and more as an opportunity to test self-control, with work, travel and other day to day life situations it was always some what of a challenge. Even though the fasts themselves did not involve going without food for long hours (certainly not days), you could always eat something from the allowed set of food items. It was still a challenge nonetheless.

One thing that my fasting experience growing up taught me that "hunger comes and goes, and it always gets better" especially with the multi-day fasts (again, there were always some allowed food items such as fruits, nuts, certain vegetables), I knew the first day was the most difficult and by the 3rd day while the mind certainly wanted certain food, the body was not missing anything and in fact felt better than it did before fasting.

I am going to discuss two types of fasting routines in this chapter, first is "time restricted eating" or the so called "intermittent fasting" and second is extended multi-day fasts (such as a 48 hour or 72 hour fasts).


## Time Restricted Eating

Chances are that you have heard about Time Restricted Eating (TRE) or as everyone likes to call it "Intermittent Fasting". As the name suggests you define a feeding window in which you eat all your food for the day and try to stick to it both for the duration and the time of day. So for example a 12-12 TRE could be eat between 8am to 8pm or said another way do not eat anything between 8pm to 8am. You could also change it to 9am to 9pm while still maintaining the 12 hour fasting and feeding window but shifting the time of day when that window occurs. Usually it is advisable to stop eating 2 (preferably 3) hours before bed time so a 8am to 8pm window is convenient. The feeding window could also be 8 hours instead of 12 in which case it becomes a 16-8 fasting and feeding cycle. In a 16-8 TRE one could wait till noon before eating anything and thus the feeding window is from 12pm to 8pm. Some people also do the 22-2 which only leaves time for "one meal a day" or OMAD as it is commonly called. Finally, there is also a 5:2 routine in which people eat regularly for 5 days and then eat very little for 2 days.

My own experiments with TRE have been that I started with 12-12 and then have graduated to 16-8 and feel very good doing it. The thing that drew me towards intermittent fasting was that it just seemed natural and tied to conventional wisdom I grew up with i.e. stop eating well before bed time and do not eat within an hour or two of waking up. So 2 hours before bedtime and 2 hours after waking up combined with 8 hours of sleep translates to 12-12 intermittent fasting. Easy. Not quite. Over the years, I had become very used to grabbing an after dinner snack while working late nights, I now believe that the late night snack and the lack of sleep were probably the root cause of me putting on so much weight. It took a little bit of effort to avoid the post dinner snack, sometimes I had a protein bar if I really felt like eating something or half a cup of almond milk, slowly but surely, my body adapted and I no longer needed that snack. In fact, now it is the opposite, if I eat a late dinner, sometimes I wake up in the night feeling extremely hungry, even though I had just eaten a few hours ago.

In early 2021, I had somewhat of an epiphany. I was dealing with multiple work related crisis and it just so happened that I ended up skipping breakfast several times during a two month period. Since the workouts were with the trainer so I could not skip those (also they were in the morning, although I did skip one or two) but I could skip breakfast, simply because I did not want an interruption. What I realized later on, was that on those days when I had skipped breakfast but did my workouts as planned, my focus was razor sharp, I could concentrate for longer duration and overall just felt better. I decided to continue the experiment even when there was no crisis and it was just a normal day and realized I indeed functioned better and had more energy if I did not eat until noon or 1pm. I decided to formally switch to 16-8 where I have my first meal of the day (which would technically be my break-fast but is actually lunch) between 1pm to 2pm and then have my dinner between 7 to 8pm (occasionally 8.30pm). I will admit that when I first started this extended experiment, I used to think after finishing my dinner that "Oh my God, am not going to be able to eat anything until lunch time tomorrow, really???" but as I realized it was actually not that difficult. I have been doing the 16-8 for most of 2021, and I find it suits my lifestyle perfectly.

While there are studies that document results from clinical trials (in both rats and humans) showing benefits of TRE both in terms of weight loss and overall health but to me it was just something that intuitively made sense. I thought why would I want to snack every now and then and keep spiking my insulin levels, feel lethargic and then as a result want to snack more and then the cycle just continues. The best part for me was that if done in accordance with our natural circadian clock it just seemed natural and not an add on activity that I had to think about doing.

I also tried the 22-2 a few times, it was fine but not something I enjoyed. Having said that, I never tried it long enough, just a day here or a couple of day there. Admittedly, I did use the 22-2 as some form of a damage control mechanism after say a weekend of eating out and late nights and it did work, but I felt it did not come naturally to me like the 16-8 so I did not pursue it. I never tried that 5:2, because it made no sense to me.

I cannot end this section without saying please read this excellent book called "The Circadian Code" by Dr Satchin Panda, it will provide you evidence based reasoning you need to try out TRE.
