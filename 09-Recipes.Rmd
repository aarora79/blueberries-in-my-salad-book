# Recipes

One of the most frequent feedback that we got on the first edition was: "how can we try some of the delicious foods that we see in the book?". While a lot of our friends have since been to our home to try some of the salads but for those whom we have not yet had the pleasure of hosting, here a few recipes that you can try out. Goes without saying, I am just the scribe here, this is all (like a lot of good things) credit to Nidhi.

## Seasame Garlic Tofu

![Seasame Garlic Tofu](pictures/Seasame-garlic-tofu.png)  
<i>Ready in 20 minutes. Serves 4 people</i>

###  Ingredients

1. Tofu 28 oz
2. Sesame oil 2 tbsp
3. Arrowroot Starch 2 tsp
4. Spring onions 5 to 6 (sliced with white and greens separated)
5. Garlic 2 flakes grated
6. Sesame seeds for garnish 1/2 tsp

### Preparation

Pre-preps for tofu:

1. This recipe tastes best with the crispy texture of tofu. To get the crispy effect tofu must be dried from outside.

2. Tofu comes submerged in water, drain the water in the sink and wash and pat dry the tofu. Then place it on a flat base with a slight angle (I did it in my kitchen sink only), sandwiched between kitchen towels and put some weight on the top of the tofu. Make sure the weight is not so much that the tofu gets crushed, however, just enough to squeeze the extra water from tofu. I used an iron skillet as the weight.
If possible, leave it like this before you go to the office and let it stay for a few hours. Or speed up the process by changing the kitchen towels frequently. This will take at-least 30 minutes.

3. Cut the tofu in about 1-inch cubes. Add the cut tofu in a platter and sprinkle cornflour. Toss the cubes to evenly coat with cornflour.

Cooking instructions:

1. Take an iron skillet and heat it before adding oil. Once hot, add oil, place the prepared tofu, do not overlap.

2. Do not turn till one side is completely done, brown all the edges. This will take around 15 minutes. (I had to do two rounds as all the tofu could not fit in one round).
3. In a bowl add all the ingredients of sauce and whisk them together. Once all sides of all tofu cubes are browned, add garlic in the skillet and saute for 30 seconds.

4. Then add all part white and half part greens of spring onion, saute for another 30 seconds. And pour the sauce on top.

5. Quickly stir and evenly quote all the tofu with the sauce. You need to cook till you get the shiny looking texture. That means the cornstarch is cooked completely. This will take 3-4 minutes.

6. Transfer them in a serving dish garnish with spring onion greens and sesame seeds.

#### Preparing Gravy:
1. In the same skillet add some water and some chili garlic sauce. Mix it well and take out all the sauce left behind in the skillet. This will make a thin gravy which I used to drizzle on my plated sesame tofu and stir-fried broccoli.

Tip: 
Arrowroot Starch can be replaced with cornstarch. To make it a complete meal for my kids, I added some rice with a gravy drizzle we ate with Cauliflower rice.
