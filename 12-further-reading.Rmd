# Read, read, read...

As they say, one good habit begets another, out of my interest to learn more about nutrition and fitness and initiated but a birthday gift from a friend I started reading books again. Unlike in the past, when I would buy books out of a genuine intent to read but then put them down after reading a few chapters, this time I actually followed through. After all, I have been working out consistently five times a week and could surely put the same power to good use elsewhere as well (at least that is what I told myself)! I have tried to weave reading into my morning routine, could be just a few pages, a few times a week but no week should go by with me not reading anything. Ten minutes with my morning coffee and a good book, and I have been able to finish five books in 2021 as of this writing.

Here is a picture from one of the more perfect mornings. Taken at an AirBnb in Smoky Mountains in the summer of 2021.
