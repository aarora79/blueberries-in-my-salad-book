# Our Diet Now

Towards the end of 2020, we had an outdoor get together with some very close friends and as we were sitting around the fire pit chatting and laughing one of friends said "bring the brinjals, lets grill them so that you can make a *baingan ka bharta*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baingan_bharta] tomorrow!". the "Baingan ka bharta" is a delicacy made with grilled minced eggplant. So we got two brinjals, they were grilled and the next day we did make the "bharta", ate it with crisp tawa rotis and green chillies. It tasted divine. The reason I mention this is that after about 8 months of eating high protein, high fiber and low carb diet, we were slowly but surely wanting to get back to traditional food that we had eaten most of our adult lives and our parents and grand-parents had eaten most of their lives. Eating the bharta that day reminded us that we missed our traditional Indian food more than what we realized. Our younger son likes "idli" very much as do we but he could eat idli three times a day seven days a week, it is a running joke in our house that he is a South Indian who is accidentally born in a North Indian family.

As more months went by, roti, rice, pulses cooked in a pressure cooker and cooked vegetables became more and more a part of our dinners as before, although we still eat grilled food multiple times a week. The lunch for us is still our favorite salads. The breakfast, however, is what is the most different because the "lunch" is the "breakfast".
