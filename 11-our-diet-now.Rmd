# Our Diet Now

Towards the end of 2020, we had an outdoor get together with some very close friends and as we were sitting around the fire pit chatting and laughing one of friends said "bring the brinjals, lets grill them so that you can make a [baingan ka bharta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baingan_bharta) tomorrow!". the "Baingan ka bharta" is a delicacy made with grilled minced eggplant. So we got two brinjals, they were grilled and the next day we did make the "bharta", ate it with crisp tawa rotis and green chillies. It tasted divine. The reason I mention this is that after about 8 months of eating what was essentially a high protein, high fiber and low carb diet, we were slowly but surely wanting to get back to traditional food that we had eaten most of our adult lives and our parents and grand-parents had eaten most of their lives. Eating the bharta that day reminded us that we missed our traditional Indian food more than we realized. Our younger son likes [Idli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idli) very much, so do we, but he could eat Idli three times a day seven days a week, it is a running joke in our house that he is a South Indian who is accidentally born in a North Indian family. Idli which is rice cake (oversimplification) is a traditional South Indian food which is popular across India and clearly in our household as well. It is heartening to see our children also enjoy foods we grew up eating.

As more months went by, roti, rice, pulses cooked in a pressure cooker and cooked vegetables became more and more a part of our dinners like they had always been. We still love our grilled veggies and chicken though and eat it multiple times a week. The lunch for us is still our favorite salads. The breakfast, however, is what is the most different because the "lunch" is the "breakfast".

## The breakfast that isn't

When we started training, and our trainer mentioned the 30 day challenge, she also mentioned something that we simply ignored (one of the rare things that she said and we just ignored). It was that she did not eat breakfast or said another way her first meal of the day with which she broke her overnight fast (breakfast) was lunch.

It did not even occur to me that it was something to consider, I did not pay much attention to it at all. As I became more interested in nutrition and in particular ageing and longevity, I started hearing more and more about intermittent fasting. Now there are two schools of thoughts, one that says you should keep eating small meals multiple times a day and another one which says you should eat two or three full meals a day and no snacks. I am putting some links to papers that talk about these approaches in the appendix chapter. Without going into details, since I am not qualified to comment on their technical correctness, I can only speak from what I experienced. Just to state it again, *whatever I am writing here is not medical advice, please consult your doctor before starting any new diet or exercise and confirm that it is appropriate for your specific situation and life circumstance. Children should not skip breakfast, my kids eat a healthy breakfast*.

By intermittent fasting, I mean a 12 hour fast and a 12 hour eating window OR a 14 hour fast and a 10 hour eating window OR a 16 hour fast and an 8 hour eating window. Depriving oneself of any and all foods that one likes during the week and then gorging on all sorts of unhealthy foods over the weekend is not my idea of intermittent fasting. I start with a 12-12 fasting and eating window and have now settled into a steady 16-8 fasting and eating window and it works great for my body and mind. While experiments done on mice show that during intermittent fasting mice that ate whatever they fancied during their eating window still saw benefits from the fasting, but certainly we can do better than mice. So my 16-8 intermittent fast means I no longer have breakfast and I feel fantastic. I prefer it much more over the eating 6 meals a day routine for several reasons that I list below.

- Eating clean and healthy 3 times a day is difficult as is in a modern city based lifestyle, eating clean and healthy 6 times a day is almost impossible unless you are an athlete and have someone whose job is to take care of your nutrition. I just don't trust myself to make the correct choice for food 6 times a day, every day.

- All weight loss is ultimately a game of keeping the insulin levels in your blood within a narrow range. Eating multiple times a day means blood sugar levels will increase in response to the carbs being broken down into glucose and that means the pancreas will produce insulin. 

All my adult life I had eaten three full meals a day, the idea there is no breakfast was so much out there that even until a few months ago I used to think that if you do not eat breakfast how do you even function. I slowly extended my 12 hour fast to 14 hours, it wasn't too bad. I realized that often times when due to some work related crisis in the morning I could not eat breakfast until noon, my mind actually worked much better, now it could simply be a result
